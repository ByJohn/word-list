# Word List

Generate lists of common words, ordered in a way that is reproducibly-random. _The randomisation of the word order is deterministic. The same form inputs will produce the same output word order_.

## Raw Word List

The raw words are in CSV files, grouped by word class (eg. noun, verb, adjective), within language directories, within the ```words``` directory.

## Tabletop Game Use

The original purpose of this web app was to supplement tabletop games that need preset lists of words, for example:

- Pictionary
- Just One
- Codenames
- Decrypto
- Banned Words
